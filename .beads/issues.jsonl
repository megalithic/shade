The issue is likely in how NSEvent key events are translated and written to the PTY.\n\n## Investigation Areas\n\n1. **Key event handling** - Check how `keyDown` events are processed\n   - Look for NSEvent handling in view controllers or custom views\n   - Check if `event.modifierFlags` includes `.shift` and if it's being used\n\n2. **Character translation** - The shifted character should come from `event.characters`, not manual shift handling\n   - `event.characters` = the actual typed character (already shift-aware)\n   - `event.charactersIgnoringModifiers` = the base key\n\n3. **PTY write path** - Verify the correct characters are being written to the PTY fd\n   - Add debug logging to see what bytes are actually sent\n\n4. **SwiftTerm or terminal emulator** - If using a library, check its key handling\n\n## Files to Investigate\n\n- Any `*ViewController.swift` or `*View.swift` with `keyDown` overrides\n- Terminal/PTY setup code\n- Any custom `NSTextInputClient` implementations\n\n## Test Case\n\n1.
