NOTICE

MegaNote embeds and statically links libghostty, a terminal emulation library
that is part of the Ghostty terminal emulator project. libghostty provides:

- Terminal emulation (VT100/xterm compatible)
- GPU-accelerated rendering via Metal
- PTY (pseudo-terminal) management

As of this writing, libghostty is not yet released as a standalone public
library. This project builds against a local copy of the GhosttyKit framework
built from the Ghostty source. When libghostty becomes publicly available as
a standalone library, this project will migrate to use the official release.

For the latest information on Ghostty and libghostty availability, see:
